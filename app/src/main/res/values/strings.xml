        <li>First, the buyer must connect the application with the cart used through the Home page of the application. This can be done in 2 ways as follows.</li>
        \t\t\t\t\t\u25BA By scanning the barcode on the cart.<br />
        \t\t\t\t\t\u25BA By entering the trolley ID manually.<br /><br />
        <li>Then, buyers will be directed to the Pay page which will later contain a Shopping List.</li><br />
        <li>Next, the buyer must point the barcode at the product he wants to buy on the camera provided on the cart, so the system can scan it.</li><br />
